# Talking Tom in Python
This is a simple talking tom clone in Python.
Note - this is just a simple command line program that records your voice for 3 seconds, saves it to an audio file, increases its pitch and plays it. This is the basic algorithm of talking tom that can be extended to detect when someone starts speaking and only process that audio.
